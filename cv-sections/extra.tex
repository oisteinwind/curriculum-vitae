I live near Roskilde with my wife Lea and my two sons, Aksel (2.5 years) and Vigge (<1 year). In my spare time I enjoy exercising by doing crossfit and try to make the gym a couple of times a week. On rare occasions I go sailing on my brothers boat and we have been as far away as Latvia. I also enjoy brewing beer although the results are of varying quality. Sometimes, however, spending time on the couch is what I prefer and Game of Thrones along with House of Cards has been my preferred pastime. I live in a community (bofællesskab) along with 27 families where we share common spaces and a common house and take turn cooking for the rest of the families four days each week. I enjoy this way of living as it entails a very good combination of social and private life.

%  %most notably are Counter Strike, World of Warcraft, Heroes of Newerth, and most recently Heroes of the Storm. 
%  While other activities are taking most of my time I still enjoy the occasional LAN with my friends.
